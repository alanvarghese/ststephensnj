              <h1>St. Stephen's Family Night </h1>
              <h2> Mission of the Family Night- "As for me and my family we will serve the Lord". (Joshua 24:15).</h2>
              <p>Vision of the family Movement- Brining Families together.</p>
              <p>The family movement of St. Stephens was started 15 years back. Family Movement meets once a month on either the 2nd or the 3rd Saturday evening at 5p.m, usually in our church. The program starts with evening prayer. During the main part of the Family Night Program, children and adults are given opportunities to share their ideas and messages. Every month there is a new MC chosen (usually children). MC leads that evening's program and they add their own jokes and riddles throughout the program. This experience will help them become great leaders in our church and community. Some of the activities in the program are Qurbana Songs, kid's message, Bible quiz, reciting of memory verses, answer section conducted by Achen, singing section for adults, and discussion for the next meeting's agenda. Occasionally we have a guest speaker. Last but not least we have something planned that everyone enjoys, a mouthwatering dinner which is usually sponsored by members.</p>
              <p>The Family Movement does a lot of charity work here in the US, and back home in India. More than $2,000 is raised by member donations and by yearly raffle. The funds raised are given for charity works such as habitat for humanity in Bergen County, sponsoring kids at St. Paul's Bhalabhavan in Puthupadi, Kerala, and financial assistance for building houses in India. Some of the other activities Family Movement members actively participate in our Sunday School, OVBS, Christmas Program, and the yearly Family Camp ( a cherished event of loved by everyone).</p>
              <p>May God Almighty continue to Bless St. Stephen's Family Movement activities.</p>
              <p>Sincerely,<br />
                Titus Mathew</p>
              <h1>Family and Youth Camp</h1>
              <p>Our 8th annual Family and Youth Camp was held at Camp Star-light in Starlight Pennsylvania from Thursday August 23 to Sunday August 26. It was a beautiful camp site where we enjoyed, relaxed and studied the words of the Good Lord.</p>
              <p>Our guest speakers for this year were Rev Fr. K.T. Varghese for the adults and Dn. Gabriel Pike for the youth. Fr. K.T. Varghese is the current manager of the Mar Elia Chapel in Shasthamkotta, Kerala. This year's theme was "Look unto Jesus" based on Hebrews 3:1. Achen was an eloquent speaker. He taught us how to get close to God even in difficult times in our lives by looking un to Jesus for the right answers.</p>
              <p>Titus Mathew and I along with all the coordinators want to thank all our members who attended the camp. I hope the camp brought our church family little closer this year. We hope and pray with these camps, every year, our church family will use it to connect with God, nature and each other.</p>
              <p>Sincerely,
                K.G. Thomas, Family & Youth Camp Coordinator</p>
              <h1>Picnic Report</h1>
              <p>St. Stephen's church picnic for the year of 2012 was held at Shepherd Lake, Ringwood State Park, NJ, 07456 on July 21, 2012. Picnic started with a Kerala style variety breakfast. Each family brought in something to help our fellowship together. The sports activities were started after the breakfast. Candy picking, musical chair, lemon race and water balloon are just some of them. Winners received their token of appreciation at the picnic site itself. Two grills and the crew worked hard to serve everyone hot hamburgers, chicken and hotdogs. With the grace of God almighty we were able to enjoy the nice warm day with family and friends. On behalf of our vicar, Rev.Fr: Babu K. Mathew and picnic coordinators Joggy Varghese and Shibu Philip, thanks each and everyone for their prayerful support for the picnic activities.</p>
              <p>Sincerely,<br />
